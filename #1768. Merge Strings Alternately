#1768. Merge Strings Alternately

#Work
#You are given two strings word1 and word2. 
#Merge the strings by alternating characters from the two strings until one of the strings is completely used up.
#If there are remaining characters after the end of either string, append them to the end of the merged string.
#Return the merged string.
